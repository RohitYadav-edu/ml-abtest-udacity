LEARNING NOTES — A/B Testing & CUPED
============================================================

This file explains everything I (Rohit) learned in this project.
Each concept is written in two ways:

1. Kid Version   — simple stories & intuition
2. Technical Version — the real statistical explanation

Anyone can learn from this. :)

------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is A/B Testing?
------------------------------------------------------------

[Kid Version]
Imagine you have two different ice-cream flavors.
You give Flavor A to some kids, and Flavor B to other kids.
Whichever flavor more kids choose is the winner.

A/B testing is the same. Two versions → two groups → compare.

[Technical Version]
A/B testing is an experiment with:
- a control group (original experience)
- an experiment group (new variant)

We measure a metric (clicks, conversions, payments) in both groups
and use statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether the 
difference is real or due to random chance.


------------------------------------------------------------
2. Conversion Funnel
------------------------------------------------------------

[Kid Version]
Think of a water slide:
- everyone climbs the stairs (pageviews)
- some start sliding (clicks)
- some reach the pool (enrollments)
- some get a popsicle after (payments)

At every stage, people drop off.

[Technical Version]
A funnel is a sequence of user actions:
CTR = Clicks / Pageviews
Enrollment Rate = Enrollments / Clicks
Payment Rate = Payments / Enrollments

We compute these for each group to understand where users drop off
and whether the experiment improves any funnel stage.


------------------------------------------------------------
3. Why We Use Hypothesis Testing
------------------------------------------------------------

[Kid Version]
Even if more kids like flavor B, it might be a coincidence if you
only asked 5 kids. You need enough kids so the result is trustworthy.

[Technical Version]
We check if differences between experiment and control are
statistically significant using a two-proportion z-test:

z = (p1 - p2) / sqrt(p * (1 - p) * (1/n1 + 1/n2))

Where p1, p2 are conversion rates.
If p-value < 0.05, the difference is unlikely to be random noise.


------------------------------------------------------------
4. Why We Use the Z-test (not just p1 and p2)
------------------------------------------------------------

[Kid Version]
Just knowing “10 kids like A and 12 like B” doesn’t tell us if the
difference is big enough to matter. We need a score that considers
sample size too.

[Technical Version]
The z-test incorporates:
- the difference in proportions
- the sample size of each group
- the pooled variance

P-values come *from* the z-score.
Z-score → probability → decision.

p-values alone without standardization would be meaningless.


------------------------------------------------------------
5. What is CUPED? (Variance Reduction)
------------------------------------------------------------

[Kid Version]
Imagine comparing kids’ running speeds.
Some kids are fast by nature.
If you adjust for each kid’s past speed, you get a fairer comparison.
This makes it easier to see if new shoes actually helped.

[Technical Version]
CUPED uses:
Y_adj = Y - θ (X - X_mean)

Where:
- Y is the experiment metric (e.g., pageviews during experiment)
- X is pre-experiment metric
- θ = Cov(Y, X) / Var(X)

This removes predictable variation from Y, lowering variance and
improving test sensitivity.


------------------------------------------------------------
6. Why CUPED Goes AFTER Regular A/B Testing
------------------------------------------------------------

[Kid Version]
First you taste ice-cream normally.
Then, only if you want more confidence, you use a "super tool"
that removes kids’ natural preferences to compare fairly.

[Technical Version]
CUPED is not meant to replace the main z-test.
It validates the robustness of the result.
You run CUPED after the baseline analysis to see if results persist
when variance is reduced.


------------------------------------------------------------
7. Final Result Interpretation
------------------------------------------------------------

[Kid Version]
The new design didn’t help enough for us to say “yes, this is better.” 
Maybe a small improvement, maybe just luck.

[Technical Version]
CUPED-adjusted p-value ≈ 0.606 (> 0.05)
→ Not statistically significant.
→ Cannot reject null hypothesis.
→ No reliable difference between control and experiment.


------------------------------------------------------------
8. What I Learned
------------------------------------------------------------

- How to calculate funnel metrics
- How to run two-proportion z-tests
- How to interpret p-values properly
- How CUPED works conceptually and mathematically
- How to check whether an experiment truly caused improvement
- How to document experiments professionally
