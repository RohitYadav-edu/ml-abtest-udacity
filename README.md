# ml-abtest-udacity
End-to-End A/B testing on the Udacity dataset with statistical analysis and CUPED.

# Udacity A/B Test Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Udacity A/B Test dataset to understand user behavior and estimate the causal impact of experiments using:
- A/B testing (z-test, p-values, confidence intervals)
- CUPED variance reduction
